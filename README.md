# PythonProjects

The first folder named django website contains my website in django as a webapp.
The django website is still in production and I am still working on the front before moving to the backend over the summer.

To test/run my website just download the files and and navigate to the directory with manage.py in the terminal.
Once in the directory use the command below to test the webapp/site.
python manage.py runserver 8001
